# NEA-project-PyGame-
This was an old project of mine I submitted for my NEA! It is a simple maze game made from PyGame with enemy A.I. that uses random movement to try and stop you from scoring.

Introduction:

The basic premise of the game is the player (green character) scores points by colliding with a star that randomly teleports to a different location after being hit. There is an enemy controlled by the computer (red character) which randomly moves to hidden nodes around the maze. When the enemy collides with the player, they will lose a point and a life.

Settings:
There are a couple of settings I have added to the game starting with the colourblind mode, this was easy to implement, literally just changes the colour variables to all the objects in the game. I also added a movement setting to allow players have straight or diagonal movement and a speed setting which changes the speed of the player and the enemy, the default speed is low and you can only make it faster. There is also a hardmode difficulty which makes it so if the player touches the walls they lose a life.
